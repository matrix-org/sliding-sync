// CalculateListOps contains the core list moving algorithm. It accepts the client's list of ranges,

// way. It returns a list of INSERT/DELETE operations, which may be zero length, as well as which rooms
// are newly added into the window.
//
//	A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I        <-- List
//	`----`    `----`         <-- RequestList.Ranges
//	DEL E | ADD J | CHANGE C <-- ListOp RoomID
//
// returns:
//
//	[ {op:DELETE, index:2}, {op:INSERT, index:0, room_id:A} ] <--- []ResponseOp
//	[ "A" ] <--- []string, new room subscriptions, if it wasn't in the window before
//
// This function will modify List to Add/Delete/Sort appropriately.
